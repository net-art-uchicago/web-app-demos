## with a custom server

![screenshot](screenshot.png)

This simple web app has the exact same client-side (browser side) code from the previous [Fetch](https://github.com/net-art-uchicago/web-app-demos/tree/fetch) example, except that rather than relying on a php or python server, we've built our own server using [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/) as well as the [express.js](https://expressjs.com/) library/framework.
