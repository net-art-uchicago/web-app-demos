# Dogs && Forecasts

This simple web app demonstrates how we can use the Web browser's [Fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) API to make requests to third party [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) APIs and then use the Web browser's [DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model) API to update/change our page's HTML code with the data we receive back from the REST APIs.


specifically we use the [Dog CEO](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/) REST API to get random dog images, as well as the [National Weather Service](https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api) REST API for getting our local forecast.
